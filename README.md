## Why Kagelin

Most productivity apps want your email before you've written a single task, and keep your data on their servers either way. Kagelin doesn't.

- **Nothing to sign up for.** Tasks, habits, focus, and calendar — all offline in guest mode. Account only if you want cloud sync.
- **Your data, your server.** Guest mode keeps everything on your device, and backs up to your own Nextcloud, Synology, or any WebDAV server. No middleman.
- **Take everything with you.** Encrypted ZIP export, full data deletion, and standard `.ics` files. Leaving is always an option.

## Features

### Tasks & Organization

- **Search** (`Ctrl/Cmd+K`): instant search across tasks, habits, and events, plus navigation and actions.
- **Task views**: Board and List view with 2D keyboard navigation.
- **Vim navigation & task controls**: `gg`/`G` navigation, `yy` yank, `p` paste, and `u` undo.
- **Split View**: Desktop List opens a master-detail panel automatically.
- **Projects**: multi-level project structure with archiving and mobile drawers.
- **Group & Filter**: group by project, priority, or due date with drag-and-drop across groups.
- **Recurring tasks**: per-task Strict (anchors to due date) or Flexible (anchors to completion) recurrence.
- **Notes editor**: markdown formatting toolbar with live preview for task notes.

### Focus & Habits

- **Focus Timer**: PiP-enabled Pomodoro engine that hands off between your devices, so pausing on one pauses on all of them.
- **Push notifications**: server-derived Web Push notifications for timer completions and task reminders (supporting desktop, Android, and iOS standalone PWA).
- **Habit tracking**: standardized tracking with longevity streaks and uhabits `.db` import.
- **Compact habit view**: tappable rolling-7 day strip with drag-and-drop reordering.
- **Activity heatmap**: visualize focus minutes and habit completions over time.

### Calendar

- **Flexible views**: Month, desktop 4-day, mobile week view with edge-gated paging, and rolling 3-day view.
- **Event creation**: quick event creation with natural language time parsing.
- **Multi-provider sync**: Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook.
- **ICS portability**: universal `.ics` (RFC 5545) import and export.

### Data Ownership

- **Guest Mode**: full-featured, zero-footprint experience in `localStorage` — no account needed.
- **Accounts & Auth**: Google, GitHub, or breach-checked email/password sign-in with multi-provider identity linking and password reset.
- **WebDAV backup**: keep a copy of everything on a server you own (Nextcloud, Synology). Available at every tier, account or not. It is a backup, not a sync: each upload replaces the last.
- **Backups & Portability**: encrypted `.zip` export/import, guest backup reminders, and instant cloud data wipe.
- **Offline-first PWA**: full offline support via service worker with stale-while-revalidate caching.
- **Telemetry**: off by default for everyone, Guest Mode included. If you opt in, we collect anonymous product-usage counts (no task titles, habit names, or other content) tied to a random device ID, never your account.

### Stats & Insights

- **Stats page**: period selector, breakdowns by project and priority, time-of-day heatmap.
- **Item insights**: per-habit and per-recurring-task stats — score history, streaks, frequency, on-time rate.
- **Goal tracking**: progress rings on habit cards, global focus and task goals.
- **Export**: analytics CSV and JSON from stats and insights panels.

### Preferences

- **Time format**: system-wide 12h/24h toggle across all time displays.
- **Keyboard accessible**: Esc closes all modals, full focus-trap and `aria-modal` compliance.
- **Haptic feedback**: standardized haptic palette for precise mobile feedback.
